To use this program first choose if you want to create parts or if you want to see what has been created. 
You will have to create every type of part first before you can create a new robot model. Once you choose 
a part to create, output on the screen will tell you the information to enter. Once all the parts have been
created you can create a new robot model with the availble parts. Once Robot Model has been created you can 
view under the Report menu and it will show what parts it is composed of.
